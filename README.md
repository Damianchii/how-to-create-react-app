For those who may be unfamiliar with or have forgotten the process of creating a React app, this guide provides step-by-step instructions along with detailed descriptions. It outlines the specific commands you should enter into your terminal to set up a React application


## Create React Project using Vite
The command npm create vite@latest is used to create a new Vite project using the latest version of the Vite template available
```bash
  npm create vite@latest
```
#### Why Vite ?
Vite is a JavaScript project build tool that focuses on speed and efficiency during the development process. It is particularly popular in the context of projects based on the Vue.js framework but can be used with other libraries such as React or Preact.

#### Follow these steps...
```bash
  ? Project name: >> "Type your project name"
```
```bash
  ? Select a framework: >> "React"
```
```bash
  ? Select a variant: >> "Javascript"
```
## Get into your project
Get into your project following this command
```bash
  cd "Project name"
```
## Install nmp 
Install nmp in your Project
```bash
  npm install
```
## Start development Server
This command used to run a script named "dev" defined in the "scripts" section of the package.json. The main idea behind using this command is to launch a local development environment, providing features like fast page refresh after code changes.
```bash
  npm run dev
```
